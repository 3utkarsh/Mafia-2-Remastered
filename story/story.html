          <h2>The American Dream</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Vito Scaletta has started to make a name for himself on the streets
            of Empire Bay as someone who can be trusted to get a job done.
            Together with his buddy Joe, he is working to prove himself to the
            Mob in the hopes of living the good life. The game follows the story
            of Vito Scaletta, a young Sicilian immigrant caught up in the power
            struggles of competing crime families in the fictional Empire Bay.
            Rising through the ranks from a common foot soldier to a "made man",
            Vito finds that doing favors for the Mob may only get him so far.
            Set in the fictional Empire Bay during the 1940s and 1950s, the
            game's story follows Vito Scaletta, a Sicilian immigrant and war
            veteran, as he becomes caught in a power struggle among the city's
            crime families while attempting to pay back his father's debts and
            secure a better lifestyle for himself.

                all in the head. Sure, it's a useful trick if you wanna meet
                someone at a specific place in the universe to have tea or
                coffee. But that's all it is, a trick. There's no such thing as
                the past, it exists only in the memory. There's no such thing as
                the future, it exists only in our imagination."
